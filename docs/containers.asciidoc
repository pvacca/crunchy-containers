== Introduction

In this document, we will describe each of the containers found
within the Crunchy Containers for PostgreSQL.

The containers and their relationships to the overall architecture
are depicted below:

image::containers.png[containers]


== crunchy-postgres 

The crunchy-postgres container executes the Postgres database.  

=== Packages

The container image is built using either the Crunchy Postgres release
or the community version based upon a flag in the Makefile.

The Crunchy postgres RPMs are available to Crunchy customers only.  The
Crunchy release is meant for customers that require enterprise level
support.

The PGDG community RPMs can be used as well by simply commenting out
the Crunchy yum repo within the Dockerfiles and uncommenting
the PGDG yum repo.

=== setup.sql

The *setup.sql* script is used to define startup SQL commands that are
executed when the database is first created.

=== Environment Variables
 
 * PG_MODE - either *master*, *slave* or *set*, this value determines whether
   the database is set up as a master or slave instance, in the
   case of *set*, it means the container is started within a StatefulSet 
   in a Kubernetes cluster.
 * PG_MASTER_USER - the value to use for the user ID created as 
   master.  The *master* user has super user priviledges.
 * PG_MASTER_PASSWORD - the password for the PG_MASTER_USER database user
 * PG_USER - the value to use for the user ID created as a normal user.
   This user is created as part of the setup.sql script upon database
   creation and allows users to predefine an application user.
 * PG_PASSWORD - the password for the PG_USER database user that is created
 * PG_DATABASE - a database that is created upon database initialization
 * PG_ROOT_PASSWORD - the postgres user password set up upon database
   initialization
 * PG_LOCALE - if set, the locale you want to create the database with, if
   not set, the default locale is used
 * SYNC_SLAVE - if set, this value is used to specify the application_name
   of a slave that will be used for a synchronous replication
 * CHECKSUMS - if set, this value is used to enable the *--data-checksums*
   option when initdb is executed at initialization, if not set, the
   default is to *not* enable data checksums
 * ARCHIVE_MODE - if set to *on*, will enable continious WAL archiving
   by setting the value within the postgresql.conf file *archive_mode*
   setting, if not set, the default is *off*
 * ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT - if set to a number (in seconds) , will specify
   the postgresql.conf *archive_timeout* setting, if not set, the 
   default value of *60* is used.
 * PGAUDIT_ANALYZE - if set, will cause the container to also start the
   pgaudit_analyze program in the background
 * PGDATA_PATH_OVERRIDE - if set, will cause the container to use a /pgdata path
   name of your choosing rather than the hostname of the container which
   is the default...this is useful for a master in a deployment.

=== Features

The following features are supported by the crunchy-postgres container:

 * use of openshift secrets
 * ability to restore from a database backup
 * use of custom pg_hba.conf and postgresql.conf files
 * ability to override postgresql.conf configuration parameters
 * ability to override the default setup.sql script
 * ability to set the database locale
 * ability to specify a synchronous slave application_name
 * ability to specify a recovery using PITR and WAL files, see
   pitr.asciidoc for a detailed design explaination of how PITR
   is implemented within the container suite

=== Locale Support

Adding locale support to the container is accomplished by
running 'yum reinstall glibc_common' within the container, this
increases the size of the container image and can be removed if you
do not require specific locale support.

You can specify the PG_LOCALE env var which is passed to the initdb
command when the initial data files are created, for example:
....
"name": "PG_LOCALE",
"value": "fr_BE.UTF-8"
....

By default, no locale is specified when the initdb command is executed.


== crunchy-backup

The crunchy-backup container executes a pg_basebackup against another
database container.  The backup is a full backup using the standard
utility included with postgres, pg_basebackup.

=== Backup Location

Backups are stored in a mounted backup volume location, using the
database host name plus *-backups*  as a sub-directory, then followed by a unique
backup directory based upon a date/timestamp.  It is left to the
user to perform database backup archives in this current version
of the container.  This backup location is referenced when performing
a database restore.

=== Dependencies

The container is meant to be using a NFS or similar network file system
to persist database backups.

=== Environment Variables

 * BACKUP_LABEL - when set, will set the label of the backup, if not
   set the default label used is *crunchy-backup*
 * BACKUP_HOST - required, this is the database we will be doing the
   backup for
 * BACKUP_USER - required, this is the database user we will be doing the
   backup with
 * BACKUP_PASS - required, this is the database password we will be doing the
   backup with
 * BACKUP_PORT - required, this is the database port we will be doing the
   backup with

== crunchy-collect 

=== Description

Postgresql metrics are collected by the crunchy-collect container.  To
start collection of metrics on a Postgres database, you add the
crunchy-collect container into the pod that holds the crunchy-pg container.

=== Requirements
Metrics are stored in the crunchy-prometheus container.  crunchy-prometheus runs
the prometheus time series database. Metrics are pushed from 
crunchy-collect to the prometheus promgateway found in the crunchy-promgateway
container.  Metrics dashboards are created using the grafana web application
which is found in the crunchy-grafana container.  

To start the metrics containers, run one of the following scripts:
....
examples/standalone/metrics/run-metrics.sh
examples/kube/metrics/run.sh
examples/openshift/metrics/run.sh
....

The crunchy-prometheus data in this example is stored in emptyDir volume types.
To persist the data and grafana templates long term, you will want to
use a pvc based  volume types as specified in *examples/openshift/metrics/run-pvc.json*.

When running the metrics containers, the following ports are available:

 * crunchy-prometheus:9090 - the prometheus web user interface
 * crunchy-promgateway:9091 - the prometheus promgateway REST API
 * crunchy-grafana:3000 - the grafana web user interface

=== crunchy-collect Environment Variables

 * POLL_INT - number of minutes to sleep until metrics are collected.  defaults to 15 minutes
 * PROM_GATEWAY - the http URL of the prometheus promgateway into which the metrics will be pushed.  defaults to http://crunchy-promgateway:9091

== crunchy-pgbadger

The crunchy-pgbadger container executes the pgbadger utility.  A small
http server is running on the container, when a request
is made to:

....
http://<<ip address>>:10000/api/badgergenerate
....

=== Environment Variables
 
 * BADGER_TARGET - only used in standalone mode to specify the
   name of the container, also used to find the location of the
   database log files in /pgdata/$BADGER_TARGET/pg_log/*.log

=== Features

The following features are supported by the crunchy-pgbadger container:

 * basic invocation of pgbadger against the database log files

== crunchy-pgpool

The crunchy-pgpool container executes the pgpool utility.  Pgpool can
be used to provide a smart postgres-aware proxy to a postgres cluster,
both master and slave, so that applications can only have to work
with a single database connection.

Postgres slaves are read-only whereas a master is both read and write
capable.

=== Environment Variables
 
 * PG_USERNAME - user to connect to postgres
 * PG_PASSWORD - user password to connect to postgres
 * PG_MASTER_SERVICE_NAME - database host to connect to for the master node
 * PG_SLAVE_SERVICE_NAME - database host to connect to for the slave node

=== Features

The following features are supported by the crunchy-pgpool container:

 * basic invocation of pgpool 

== crunchy-watch

We create a container, crunchy-watch, that runs as a pod unto itself
typically.  The watch container essentially does a health check
on a master database container and performs a failover sequence
if the master is not reached.

The watch container has access to a service account that is used
inside the container to issue commands to openshift.

You set up the SA using this:

oc create -f watch-sa.json

You then set up permissions for the SA to edit stuff in the openshift project,
this example allows all service accounts to edit resources in the *default*
project:

....
oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts -n default
....

You then reference the SA within the POD spec.

The oc/docker/kubectl commands are included into the container from the 
host when the container image is built.  These commands are used by
the watch logic to interact with the replica containers.

=== Environment Variables

 * SLEEP_TIME - the time to sleep in seconds between checking on the master
 * WAIT_TIME - the time to sleep in seconds between triggering the failover and updating its label (default is 40 secs)
 * PG_MASTER_SERVICE -  the master service name
 * PG_SLAVE_SERVICE - the slave service name
 * PG_MASTER_PORT - database port to use when checking the database
 * PG_MASTER_USER -  database user account to use when checking the database
   using pg_isready utility
 * PG_DATABASE - database to use when checking the database using pg_isready
 * SLAVE_TO_TRIGGER_LABEL - this is the pod name of a replica that you
   want to choose as the new master in a failover, this will override
   the normal replica selection 

=== Logic

The watch container will watch the master, if the master dies, then 
the watcher will:

 * create the trigger file on the slave that will become the new master
 * change the labels on the slave to be those of the master
 * will start watching the new master in case that falls over next
 * will look for slaves that have the metadata label value of *slavetype=trigger* to prefer
   the failover to, if found it will use the first slave with that label, if
   not found, it will use the first slave it finds

Example of looking for the failover slave:
....
oc get pod -l name=pg-slave-rc-dc
NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pg-slave-rc-dc           1/1       Running   2          16m
pg-slave-rc-dc-1-96qs8   1/1       Running   1          16m

oc get pod -l slavetype=trigger
NAME             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pg-slave-rc-dc   1/1       Running   2          16m
....

== crunchy-dba 

The crunchy-dba container implements a cron scheduler.  The purpose
of the crunchy-dba container is to offer a way to perform
simple DBA tasks that occur on some form of schedule such as
backup jobs or running a vacuum on a *single* Postgres database container.

You can either run the crunchy-dba container as a single pod or include
the container within a database pod.

The crunchy-dba container makes use of a Service Account to perform
the startup of scheduled jobs.  The Kube Job type is used to execute
the scheduled jobs with a Restart policy of Never.

=== Environment Variables

The following environment variables control the actions
of crunchy-dba:

 * OSE_PROJECT - required, the OSE project name to log into
 * JOB_HOST - required, the postgres container name the action will be taken against
 * VAC_SCHEDULE - if set, this will start a vacuum job container.  The
 setting value must be a valid cron expression as described below.
 * BACKUP_SCHEDULE - if set, this will start a backup job container.  The
 setting value must be a valid cron expression as described below.

For a vacuum job, you are required to supply the following
environment variables:

 * JOB_HOST
 * PG_USER
 * PG_PASSWORD
 * PG_DATABASE - defaults to postgres when not specified
 * PG_PORT - defaults to 5432 when not specified
 * VAC_ANALYZE(optional) - defaults to true when not specified
 * VAC_FULL(optional) - defaults to true when not specified
 * VAC_VERBOSE(optional) - defaults to true when not specified
 * VAC_FREEZE(optional) - defaults to false when not specified
 * VAC_TABLE(optional) - defaults to all tables when not specified, or you can set this value to indicate a single table to vacuum

For a backup job, you are required to supply the following
environment variables:

 * JOB_HOST
 * PG_USER - database user used to perform the backup
 * PG_PASSWORD - database user password used to perform the backup
 * PG_PORT - port value used when connecting for a backup to the database
 * BACKUP_PV_CAPACITY - a value like 1Gi is used to define the PV storage capacity
 * BACKUP_PV_PATH - the NFS path used to build the PV
 * BACKUP_PV_HOST - the NFS host used to build the PV
 * BACKUP_PVC_STORAGE - a value like 75M means to allow 75 megabytes for the PVC used
 in performing the backup


=== CRON Expression Format

A cron expression represents a set of times, using 6 space-separated fields.

.Table Fields
|===
|Field name   | Mandatory? | Allowed values  | Allowed special characters

|Seconds      
|Yes        
|0-59            
|* / , -

|Minutes      
|Yes        
|0-59            
|* / , -

|Hours        
|Yes        
|0-23            
|* / , -

|Day of month 
|Yes        
|1-31            
|* / , - ?

|Month        
|Yes        
|1-12 or JAN-DEC 
|* / , -

|Day of week  
|Yes        
|0-6 or SUN-SAT  
|* / , - ?
|===


Note: Month and Day-of-week field values are case insensitive.  "SUN", "Sun",
and "sun" are equally accepted.

==== Special Characters

===== Asterisk ( * )

The asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values 
of the field; e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would 
indicate every month.

===== Slash ( / )

Slashes are used to describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in 
the 1st field (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every 
15 minutes thereafter. The form "*\/..." is equivalent to the form 
"first-last/...", that is, an increment over the largest possible range of 
the field.  The form "N/..." is accepted as meaning "N-MAX/...", that is, 
starting at N, use the increment until the end of that specific range.  
It does not wrap around.

===== Comma ( , )

Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using 
"MON,WED,FRI" in the 5th field (day of week) would mean Mondays, 
Wednesdays and Fridays.

===== Hyphen ( - )

Hyphens are used to define ranges. For example, 9-17 would indicate every
hour between 9am and 5pm inclusive.

===== Question mark ( ? )

Question mark may be used instead of '*' for leaving either day-of-month or
day-of-week blank.

==== Predefined schedules

You may use one of several pre-defined schedules in place of a cron expression.

.Table Predefined Schedules
|===
|Entry|Description|Equivalent To

|@yearly (or @annually) 
| Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st        
| 0 0 0 1 1 *

|@monthly               
| Run once a month, midnight, first of month 
| 0 0 0 1 * *

|@weekly                
| Run once a week, midnight on Sunday        
| 0 0 0 * * 0

|@daily (or @midnight)  
| Run once a day, midnight                   
| 0 0 0 * * *

|@hourly                
| Run once an hour, beginning of hour        
| 0 0 * * * *
|===

==== Intervals

You may also schedule a job to execute at fixed intervals.  This is 
supported by formatting the cron spec like this:

....
@every <duration>
....

where "duration" is a string accepted by time.ParseDuration
(http://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).

For example, "@every 1h30m10s" would indicate a schedule that activates every
1 hour, 30 minutes, 10 seconds.

Note: The interval does not take the job runtime into account.  For example,
if a job takes 3 minutes to run, and it is scheduled to run every 5 minutes,
it will have only 2 minutes of idle time between each run.

==== Time zones

All interpretation and scheduling is done in the machines local 
time zone (as provided by the Go time package 
(http://www.golang.org/pkg/time).  Be aware that jobs scheduled during 
daylight-savings leap-ahead transitions will not be run!

== crunchy-pgbouncer
