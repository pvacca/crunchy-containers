== Openshift Dedicated Environment

Here are instructions for running examples on an Openshift Dedicated
environment.  For Dedicated, we have built a set of templates
that can be installed into a Dedicated instance to help automate
the creation of Crunchy Container Suite containers.

=== Installation

Users can install the templates into their Openshift environment 
using the following commands:
....
oc login
oc project <your project name>
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers.git
export CCPROOT=$HOME/crunchy-containers
export CCP_IMAGE_TAG=centos7-9.5-1.3
cd crunchy-containers/examples/templates
./create-all.sh
....

=== Example Details

Each example will build a template to be later used by
users when they want to deploy a Crunchy container.

The templates are installed by running the following script
within each example directory:

....
./run.sh
....

When you run the examples, there are variable substitutions taking
place to set the image path and image tags within the Openshift
templates.  This substitution allows for better support of different
deployments and deployment environments.

=== database backup

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-database-backup*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/backup
....

This template will create the following:
 * Job which generates a backup container

This example deploys a Job which results in a Pod
created which will run the crunchy-backup container.  It
will create a backup of a database and store the backup
files in a PVC.

=== Badger

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-database-with-pgbadger*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/badger
....

This template will create the following:
 * database container (emptyDir)
 * pgbadger container
 * database service

=== Metrics Collection

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-database-with-collect*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/collect
....

This template will create the following:
 * database container (emptyDir)
 * collect container
 * database service

This example will pull postgres metrics from the database
and push them to the metrics backend.

=== Metrics Collection and Badger Analysis

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-database-with-collect-badger*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/master-collect-badger
....

This template will create the following:
 * master database container (emptyDir)
 * collect container
 * badger container
 * master database service

This example will pull postgres metrics from the database
and push them to the metrics backend as well as provide
a pgbadger container for log analysis.

=== Master - Replica Database Cluster

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-master-replica-emptydir*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/master-replica
....

This template will create the following:
 * database container as the master (emptyDir)
 * database container as the replica (emptyDir)
 * database service for the master
 * database service for the replica

This example deploys a master-replica configuration
which uses emptyDir for persistence. 

=== Master - Replica Database Cluster using DeploymentConfig for Replica

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-master-replica-deployment-emptydir*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/master-slave-dc
....

This template will create the following:
 * database container as the master (emptyDir)
 * DeploymentConfig for the replica (emptyDir) allowing scaling
 * database service for the master
 * database service for the replica

This example deploys a master-slave configuration
which uses emptyDir for persistence.  The DeploymentConfig allows
you to scale up the number of replica containers.

=== Restore Database

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-database-restore-emptydir*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/master-restore
....

This template will create the following:
 * database container (emptyDir)
 * database service

This example performs a database restore using a backup archive
found in a PVC.

=== Metrics 

Template Name is *crunchy-metrics*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/metrics
....

This template will create the following:
 * prometheus container (PVC for persistence)
 * grafana container (PVC for persistence)
 * promgateway container  
 * services for prometheus, grafana, and promgateway

This example deploys all the required metrics containers
which are used to store and visualize collected postgres metrics.
The example uses a single PVC to store all the metrics and
dashboard data.

=== pgadmin4 

Template Name is *crunchy-pgadmin4-using-pvc*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/pgadmin4
....

This template will create the following:
 * pgadmin4 container (PVC for persistence)
 * service for pgadmin4

This example deploys the pgadmin4 container and uses
a PVC to persist the data.

=== pgbouncer 

Template Name is *crunchy-pgbouncer*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/pgbouncer
....

This template will create the following:
 * pgbouncer container 
 * PVC to hold configuration 
 * service for pgbouncer

=== pgpool 

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-pgpool-template*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/pgpool
....

This template will create the following:
 * pgpool container within a DeploymentConfig
 * service for pgpool

This example deploys the pgpool container and service.  The DeploymentConfig
allows you to scale up the pgpool container.

=== replica with DeploymentConfig

Template names is *crunchy-postgres-replica-deployment-emptydir*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/replica-dc
....

These templates create the following:
 * replica database container using emptyDir volume and a DeploymentConfig
   allowing scaling
 * service for replica 

This example deploys a single replica container which
uses emptyDir that can be scaled up within a DeploymentConfig.

=== secrets

Template names are *master-with-secrets-example*.

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/secret
....

This run.sh script creates the following:
 * master database container using emptyDir volume 
 * service for database 
 * secrets to hold database credentials


=== single master database 

Template names are *crunchy-postgres-database-emptydir* and
*crunchy-postgres-database-pvc*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/single-master
....

These templates create the following:
 * master database container using emptyDir volume or a PVC
 * service for database 

This example deploys a single database container which
uses emptyDir or a PVC for volume persistence.

=== replica database

Template names are *crunchy-postgres-replica-emptydir* and
*crunchy-postgres-replica-pvc*.

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/single-replica
....

This template will create the following:
 * replica database container using emptyDir or PVC as the data volume
 * service to the replica

This example deploys a replica database pod using either
emptyDir or a PVC to store data.  A service is also
created to the replica.

=== synchronous replica database

Template Name is *crunchy-postgres-master-sync-replica-pvc*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/sync
....

This template will create the following:
 * PVC for the master database
 * PVC for the replica database
 * master database container using PVC as the data volume
 * replica database container using PVC as the data volume
 * service to the master database
 * service to the replica database

This example deploys a database pod using a PVC to store data.  
A service is also created to the database.  This example creates
a synchronous replica.

=== watch

Template Name is *crunchy-cluster-watch-template*

Example is found here:
....
examples/templates/watch
....

This template will create the following:
 * watch pod for watching a database cluster

This example deploys a watch pod that watches a database
master, if the master dies, it will trigger a failover to
a replica.  This pod uses a ServiceAccount which is required
to be defined.
